Summary of revision:
First major thing is splitting my webpage into 3 seperate pages; Home, About Me, and Gallery

Home: shows the new inverse nave bar at the top that contains links to my other pages as well
as the drop down menu for my GUI I Programming Homework links to the completed homeworks so far.
Beside that it serves and an introduction to my website where I use a container within a jumbotron
to have my items more emphasized but centered with the jumbotron overlapping the background color.
Within the container is a header img and <p> where I use column "cd-md-push-4" to set my picture to the right side.

About Me: Here have a container fluid with row in it to balance my two elements side by side, first is
my about me section which is a jumbotron about me just talking about who I am and my CS experience
I Then have a Panel the CS course i've taken at UMass Lowell with each course being a button linking
to the course catalog that describes the course in question.

Gallery: Here I took the two images I had in my original webpage but set they upside by side within thumbnails
and with captions describing the text below them for a more clean presentation from before. Here I borrowed
W3 img gallery example and made it with 2 images using the thumbnail class to show a white background
behind each image
